# MiniMart

MiniMart is a demo app created to showcase clean code structure and best practices.

✨ Key Principles
- Clean & readable code  
- Single responsibility per file  
- Reusable components  
- Predictable state flow  
- Scalable folder structure  
- Platform-agnostic logic where possible  

🚀 Getting Started

Note: Make sure you have completed the official React Native Environment Setup up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

From the root of the project:

# using npm

npm install

# OR using Yarn

yarn install
Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

Start Metro from the project root:

# using npm

npm start

# OR using Yarn

yarn start

Keep this terminal running.

Step 3: Run the Application

Open a new terminal from the project root while Metro is running.

📱 Android

# using npm

npm run android

# OR using Yarn

yarn android
🍎 iOS

First install CocoaPods dependencies:

cd ios
pod install
cd ..

Then run the app:

# using npm

npm run ios

# OR using Yarn

yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, the app should launch in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

You can also run the app directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

🛠 Development Scripts
